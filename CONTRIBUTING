1. CURRENT STATUS

The current task is bringing over all of the headers and definitions,
reworked under the new practises and guidelines. For the time being,
outside contribution is not realistic, as the aforementioned guidelines
will need a little documentation first.

2. ROUGH ROADMAP

Here is what the development track looks like so far:

1. Fill in include/const/
2. Copywrite all of the other headers into include/
3. Devise some scripts in util/ for processing data/ (some already
   exist)
4. Define a predictable schema for a hierarchy of asset data
5. Migrate all of the asset data into the newly-defined hierarchy
6. Begin porting the source

3. HOW THIS WORKS

The process here is whole-hog, rather than test-driven. The reason is
because in most respects it is a clean rewrite, and a good
understanding of the engine will be necessary in order to realise the
goal of an improved codebase anyway. It will not be easy, but it will
be worth it.
