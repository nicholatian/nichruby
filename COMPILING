nichruby compilation guide

*****

This project uses GNU Make. It supports job control. It is possible to
build nichruby on any Unix-like platform, but only Linux and macOS are
actively used by the maintainer. Other operating systems are not
supported. Simply run make and the ROM file will be built.
